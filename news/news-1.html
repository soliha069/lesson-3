      “Today at the headquarters of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in
      Beijing we had a productive meeting with the president of the bank Jin
      Liqun,” Saidov wrote in his Telegram channel. At the meeting, the parties
      discussed the current state of bilateral relations and prospects for their
      further development. “We appreciate the bank’s commitment to further
      supporting reforms taking place in Uzbekistan. We have every opportunity
      to increase the number of joint projects with the bank,” he said. It
      should be recalled that on May 19 this year, during a state visit to the
      PRC, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev received the President of the Asian
      Infrastructure Investment Bank, Jin Liqun, in the city of Xi’an. The
      parties discussed the implementation of several joint projects.
